# MinimaxAgentwithAlphaBetaPruning

The Fruit Rage is a two player game in which each player tries to maximize his/her share from a batch of fruits randomly placed in a box. The box is divided into cells and each cell is either empty or filled with one fruit of a specific type.

At the beginning of each game, all cells are filled with fruits. Players play in turn and can pick a cell of the box in their own turn and claim all fruit of the same type, in all cells that are connected to the selected cell through horizontal and vertical paths. For each selection or move the agent is rewarded a numeric value which is the square of the number of fruits claimed in that move. Once an agent picks the fruits from the cells, their empty place will be filled with other fruits on top of them (which fall down due to gravity), if any. In this game, no fruit is added during game play. Hence, players play until all fruits have been claimed.

Another big constraint of this game is that every agent has a limited amount of time to spend for thinking during the whole game. Spending more than the original allocated time will be penalized harshly. Each player is allocated a fixed total amount of time. When it is your turn to play, you will also be told how much remaining time you have. The time you take on each move will be subtracted from your total remaining time. If your remaining time reaches zero, your agent will automatically lose the game. Hence you should think about strategies for best use of your time (spend a lot of time on early moves, or on later moves?)

The overall score of each player is the sum of rewards gained for every turn. The game will terminate when there is no fruit left in the box or when a player has run out of time.
